Hi, I’m Khalil. Few years ago, I left a Psychology master’s to pursue IT engineering—a decision that set me on an incredible adeventure.

I started with front-end development, freelancing for startups with React and then switched to full stack development, using my skills to digitalize services and build multitenancy eCommerce platforms. But my curiosity pushed me deeper into DevOps, where I saw the IT field as a digital version of supply chain similar to what you would see in real life buisnesses and learned about the full lifecycle of a software from the development up to the delivery, maintenance and administration of the hosting platform, managing DNS records, securing the Linux server, deciding the right choice of the web server...

Specializing academically in Cloud and IT Infrastructure, I mastered virtualization, system administration, and Kubernetes—earning my CKA. Linux became my daily OS, and Go transformed how I build scalable systems, especially during my time at Orbem GmbH.

Now? I’m still eager to learn more about how things work. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
