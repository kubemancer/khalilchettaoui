Hello, I'm Khalil. Who am I, you might wonder? I'm a human being who, five years ago, decided to drop out of my Psychology master's program to pursue an idea—the idea of becoming an IT Engineer.

Throughout my journey to earning a master's degree in IT engineering, I explored many fields. I started with front-end development during the COVID era, learning about web development and full-stack JavaScript. That led me to my first freelance position as a React developer with Idania, a Swedish food-tech startup.

After six months with Idania, I had another opportunity to work as a front-end developer with Aigot, an Italian startup focused on restaurant and pharmacy management, where I helped build a multi-tenancy eCommerce solution. But I always wanted to push myself further. That drive led me to transition into full-stack MERN development.

Curious about what happens behind the software, I delved deeper and discovered DevOps two years ago. That’s when I fell in love with infrastructure and the world of automation. I realized that what we build in DevOps is essentially a digital version of supply chain management. Seeing those real-life parallels helped me connect the dots between modern infrastructure and the entire software development lifecycle.

Knowing I had found my passion, I decided to specialize in Cloud Computing and IT Infrastructure at university. There, I learned the theoretical foundations—from virtualization and system administration to containerization and DevOps. It felt like learning the history of tech itself.

Recognizing the shift toward cloud-native technologies, I specialized in Kubernetes, beginning with the CKA certification—the first of many Kubernetes certifications I hope to earn. I'm also passionate about Linux and have been using Linux/Unix-based operating systems as my daily drivers for the past five years.

As for Go, I fell in love with the language during my DevOps internship at Orbem GmbH. My manager convinced me to try it, and I was immediately drawn to its simplicity, performance, and efficiency. Learning Go also meant learning the language that Kubernetes is built with, making it even more valuable to me.

And that's a bit about me! I hope you found my journey into IT as fascinating as it has been for me.
