Hello, I'm Khalil. Who am I, you might ask? Just a human who, five years ago, made the crazy decision to drop out of a Psychology master's program to chase a dream—becoming an IT Engineer.

That decision set me on an incredible journey. I dived headfirst into tech, experimenting with different fields. My first love? Front-end development. During COVID, I started learning about web development and full-stack JavaScript, which led me to my first freelance gig as a React developer with Idania, a Swedish food-tech startup.

After six months, another opportunity knocked. This time, it was Aigot, an Italian startup focused on restaurant and pharmacy management. There, I helped build a multi-tenancy eCommerce platform. But something inside me kept pushing for more. I wanted to understand not just how to build software, but everything happening behind the scenes.

That curiosity pulled me into DevOps two years ago, and that’s where everything clicked. I saw DevOps not just as a set of tools, but as a digital version of supply chain automation. It was about optimizing processes, making things flow seamlessly—just like in the real world. That realization changed everything for me.

Knowing I had found my path, I specialized in Cloud Computing and IT Infrastructure at university. I dove deep into virtualization, system administration, containerization, and DevOps—essentially learning the history and evolution of modern tech. And as the world moved toward cloud-native technologies, I knew Kubernetes was the next frontier. That’s why I pursued my CKA certification, the first of (hopefully) many Kubernetes certs to come.

Then there’s Linux—my everyday companion. For the past five years, Linux and Unix-based systems have been my go-to. They just make sense to me.

And Go? That was a game changer. While working on platform development projects at Orbem GmbH, I got to use Go extensively. My manager, coming from a development background, was a big fan of it, and the more I worked with it, the more I saw why. Its simplicity, performance, and efficiency made it a perfect fit for building scalable systems. Plus, knowing that Kubernetes itself is built with Go made it even more exciting to learn.

So yeah, that’s my journey so far. A mix of risk-taking, curiosity, and an obsession with figuring out how things work. And honestly? I wouldn't have it any other way.
